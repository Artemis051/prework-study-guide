     <ul>
       <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
       <li>The body element represents visible content shown to the user</li>
       <li> 'html lang="en"' tells us the website will be in English</html></li>
       <li>The meta element contains information about the page that is used by the browser.</li>
       <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. The element that holds all the children is known as the parent element</li>
       <li>The 'ul', 'ol', and 'li' elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists. </li>
        <li>The 'img' element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location or source of the image</li>
        <li>the 'a' element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages</li>
          <li>The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image</li>
          <li>The declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened ('DOCTYPE html')</li>

          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users</li>
          <li> A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>a link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
          <li>The 'rel' attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The 'href' attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location </li>
